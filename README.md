=============
This is a small player and ripper script for spotify. It rips playlists to mp3 and includes ID3 tags.

It is largely based on both spotifyripper-projects by AndersTornkvis and robbeofficial respectively.
Please note that this is intended to be a learning project, i.e. improving python coding skills at a practical example. The code is likely to be a lot messier and clumsy than in the original versions. 
That does not mean, however, that I do not want to share the code. If you happen to find something useful here for your own project, then by all means, go ahead.

NOTE: stream ripping violates the ToS of libspotify, spotify and, possibly, local copyright laws. Don't do that.

usage: jbripper [-h] -u USER -p PASSWORD -U URL [-l [LIBRARY]] [-O OUTPUTDIR]
                [-P] [-V VBR] [-I] [-f | -d]

features
--------
* real-time VBR ripping from spotify PCM stream

* writes id3 tags (including album covers)

* creates files and directories based on the followng structure artist/album/song.mp3

* Check for existing songs


prerequisites:
--------------
* lame, python-dev and eyeD3 installed (via apt-get)

* libspotify (download at https://developer.spotify.com/technologies/libspotify/, install via included make.install). you may need other -dev packages, check make errors if they occur.

* pyspotify (sudo pip install -I pyspotify==1.11)

* a binary appkey by spotify (download at developer.spotify.com and copy to wd, requires premium!)


TODO
----
- [ ] check fork for sensible improvements
- [ ] skip exisiting track (avoid / completed tracks / completed = successful id3)
- [ ] detect if other spotify instance is interrupting
- [ ] add album supprt : spotify:album:1UnRYaeCev9JVKEHWBEgHe
- [ ] update to support pyspotify v2.x (breaks module calls)
